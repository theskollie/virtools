Virtools is an essential addon to your 3Commas experience. It enables you to manage your DCA bots with greater analytics, real-time alerting, and tons of additional features.

## Features

## How to access?
Virtools is currently accessible through an Electron app which is available natively on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.  
We're currently developing a web-app which can be accessed from all devices.

## Frontend Stack
Frontend Developed with TypeScript, React, Mantine UI.  
Our Frontend source is open-source on Github Pages, however certain pages like the login are not fully functional as it is a redirect to our seperate web-app.

## Initial Setup
If you want to run a local copy, run the following commands.
- `git clone https://github.com/theskollie/virtools`
- `cd virtools`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

TypeScript is used so a compile is required on each launch.
